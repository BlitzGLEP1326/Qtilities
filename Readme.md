Introduction
------------

Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for developers using C++ or QML, a CSS & JavaScript like language. It is an exciting piece of technology, supporting all major desktop operating systems as well as an increasing range of mobile operating system.

Qtilities is a suite of well documented and mature Qt libraries which provides building blocks for Qt applications, allowing rapid application development. The project consists of different modules which provide features which are common to a wide range of Qt applications, with the main goal of making common things easier to do.

Building & Getting Started
--------------------------

The following files in the repository's root folder will guide you through the process of building Qtilities:

* On Windows see "Building on Windows.txt"
* On Linux see "Building on Linux.txt"

Alternatively see http://www.qtilities.org/docs/master/page_getting_started.html. The documentation can be compiled by providing Doxygen with the /doc/doxyfile_website input file. On Windows you can run the /doc/win32_website.bat file directly if doxygen is in your path. Note that Doxygen versions prior to v1.7.4 generates garbage in some parts of the documentation.
