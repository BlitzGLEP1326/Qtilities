Qtilities Source Archive Readme:

The source archive consists of the following folders
/include     - All include files
/src         - Sources
/doc         - Documentation

This archive contains files which will guide you throught the process of building Qtilities:
- On Windows see "Building on Windows.txt"
- On Linux see ""Building  on Linux.txt"

Alternatively see http://www.qtilities.org/docs/v1_0/page_getting_started.html. The online documentation can also be compiled the sources by providing Doxygen with the /doc/doxyfile_website input file. On Windows you can run the /doc/win32_website.bat file directly if doxygen is in your path. Note that Doxygen versions prior to v1.7.4 generates garbage in some parts of the documentation.
