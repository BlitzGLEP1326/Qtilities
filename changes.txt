================================
Things planned for the far future...
In no particular order:
================================
- Make core classes thread-safe.
- ObserverSceneGraph.
- Task management classes.
- Unit tests on all applicable classes.
- Port some scientific classes (Matrices, Models etc.) to a new Qtilities lib.

================================
Things outstanding for v0.3 release:
================================
- Property editor must refresh when properties changes.
- Test Observer copy constructor.
- Problem where mode switching causes setNewContext() to be called twice. Check session log plugin mode for example.
- Command editor widget, remove dependency on property browser lib.
- Action manager:
    - Fix action manager not assigning backend action shortcut in tooltip and does not work. See codeeditorwidget for example in Firmware Manager.
    - Action manager should act as a pointer list when commands are deleted. Thus they should be removed.
- Linux problems:
    - Sort out Linux dll versioning
    - Update getting started doc to show how to install git on windows, and to add /bin to path in linux
- ObserverDotGraph finish & blog post
- Unit testing + some tests off course
- Probleem met QtilitiesCore. Om te sien verander TreeNode.h om QtilitiesCore te include.
- Getting started article should show more: QtilitiesMainWindow.
- Must update images in ObjectManagement and MainWindow examples.
- Main Window Example xml projects does not work.
- Add tree depth function to TreeNode.
- In tree structure page, first image uses FileTreeItem, instead of TreeFileItem.
- Use seperate release and debug folders.
- Modes does not get shortcuts at startup. Only when switching. See Firmware Tool for example.
- Debug plugin must be completed:
    - Conan Integration
    - Add debugging Qtilities applications page to docs.
- Define something like qti_ for classes which must be internal, thus not documented.

================================
Qtilities v0.3 Implemented Changes
================================
    General:
    ============================
    - Documentation
        - Documentation now uses Doxygen's COLORSTYLE parameters to style the docs properly.
        - Getting Started article improved and updated, especially the Linux information.
        - The Basics article now uses a more usefull example. The previous one did not compile either.
        - At this stage proper documentation is still lacking on a class level for many classes. There is an effort to document these classes and below is a list of classes that were properly documented for this release:
            - Qtilities::CoreGui::SearchBoxWidget
            - Qtilities::Core::ObserverRelationalTable
            - Qtilities::Core::RelationalTableEntry
    - Some places in Qtilities uses folders under the application directory, for example: "/session" to save data like logging configurations, shortcut mappings etc. Previously these save operations failed if there was no session directory under the application folder. In this version the "/session" directory is automatically created when needed.
    - Removed Qtilities::Plugin::Help namespace from documentation. This plugin is not part of Qtilities yet.
    - Got rid of all the "warning: type qualifiers ignored on function return type" & unused parameter warnings when building with gcc.
    - Ubuntu: Fixed icon display & resource loading problems.
    - Added this changes.txt file.
    - Added needed Q_UNUSED on unused variables throughout the libraries.

    ============================
    QtilitiesLogging:
    ============================
    New Feature:
    - Logging: Concept of message contexts introduced allowing control over which messages are accepted by individual engines.

    Improvements and Notable Changes:
    - LoggerGui got a new createTempLogWidget() function which provides an easy to use temporary log widgets to display log messages during extensive processing operations.
    - Logger will now automatically create the /session/ directory if it does not exist when trying to export the logging configuration.
    - Logger now checks that multiple engines with the same name can't be added.
    - Logger now restores logger engine specific parameters correctly from .logconfig files.
    - WidgetLoggerFrontend::isFormattingEngineConstant() now returns true by default.

    Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed bug in Logger which would have caused a crash during logger config exports if any engine was deleted during runtime.
    - Fixed crash in FileLoggerEngine::finalize() if it had no formatting engine.
    - Fixed bug where Logger::enableEngine() and Logger::disableEngine() was switched around, thus they did the opposite of what they had to do.

    ============================
    QtilitiesCore:
    ============================
    New Classes:
    - Added QtilitiesFileInfo class.
    - New FileUtils class. At present this file contains a static function to remove a directory along with all its contents. In the future all file related functionality will be added to this class.

    Improvements and Notable Changes:
    - Observers
        - Observer::refreshViewsLayout() got new parameter to allow you to select specific objects in your views.
        - Observer's layoutChanged() signal got a new parameter which will contain references of added objects if addition of objects triggered the signal, or if a paramater was passed through the refreshViewsLayout() signal.
        - OBSERVER_UNCATEGORIZED_CATEGORY is now removed. Thus you can add categorized and uncategorized subjects to the same observer.
        - Observer::setDisplayHints() is now obsolete. It is replaced by Observer::inheritDisplayHints().
        - New ObserverHints::ModificationStateDisplayHint hint which allows the modification state of items to be displayed in observer widgets. This hint is now part of binary and XML tree exports.
        - Improved XML importing/exporting of observers.
        - Observer & Project modification state optimizations. When notifying subjects it no longer let them notify their listeners as well since this results in a huge amount of recursive signals emissions. The order in which subjects and listeners are notified also changed: Subjects are first notified and then listeners, in this way listeners can check the modiciation state and it would return the correct results.
        - Whenever it is needed to emit the numberOfSubjectChanged() signal, Observer will now first set the modification state of the Observer to true and then emit the signal. This allows you to react to changes in the number of subjects and perform actions such as saving your project automatically etc.
        - Previously observer deleted objects directly when needed in its constructor as well as when an object was detached and went out of scope. This was changed to call deleteLater() on those objects, making it safer for objects living in other threads.
    - Subject Filters
        - Now easier to implement since most AbstractSubjectFilter's abstract functions got default implementations.
        - ActivitySubjectFilter got a new setActiveSubject() function set a single item active in an observer context.
        - AbstractSubjectFilter got two new functions to control if the subject filter's modification state must be monitored by its observer context. ActivityPolicyFilter got new get and set functions to support this. By default all Qtilities subject filters return true. Observers now respect this property and do not monitor the modification state of subject filters returning false. TreeNode::enableActivityControl() now has a parameter to disable modification monitoring.
        - Changed behavior where ActivityPolicyFilter's policy set functions would not have worked if the filter already had an observer context associated with it.
        - Changed behavior where SubjectTypeFilter's set functions would not have worked if the filter already had an observer context associated with it.
        - All subject filters which forms part of %Qtilities are not exportable by default.
        - New ActivityPolicyFilter::ParentTrackingPolicy policy which resulted in the following additional changes:
            - TreeNode::enableActivityControl() updated to include this new policy.
            - This policy is now part of binary and XML tree exports.
            - Default policies for ActivityPolicyFilter changed. See the documentation for the new defaults.
    - General
        - IExportable is now much easier to use. All export functions now have default implementations which exports the InstanceFactoryInfo of the object. Thus you can create objects which will be exported/imported successfully without having to implement any of the export/import functions.
        - New ObserverRelationalTable::refresh() method which can be used to refresh the table data after an observer changed.
        - IContextManager::currentContexts() is now called IContextManager::activeContexts().

    Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed bug in SubjectTypeFilter::evaluateAttachment() in cases where inversed filtering was enabled and no known types were added.
    - Fixed bug where Observer ended a processing cycle before emitting the numberOfSubjectsChanged() signal.
    - Fixed memory leak in ActivityPolicyFilter destructor.
    - Fixed memory leak in ObserverRelationalTable destructor.
    - Fixed memory leak in SubjectFilterTemplate.
    - Fixed bugs in Observer::treeCount(), Observer::treeChildren() and Observer::isParentInHierarchy() when using the containment tree building approach.
    - Fixed bug where ObserverRelationalTable did not remove OBSERVER_VISITOR_ID properties in its destructor.
    - Fixed bug where Observer::exportXML() did not take the exportability property of subject filters into account. This resulted in subject filters always being exported.
    - Fixed bug where Observer::deleteAll() did not change the modification state of the observer.
    - Fixed bug in Observer where the QtilitiesPropertyChangeEvent for subject filter's monitoredProperties() were not delivered correctly.
    - Fixed internal handling of processing cycles in Observer. This could have caused user defined processing cycles to be ended incorrectly during some function calls such as attachSubjects() etc.
    - Fixed possible crash in ActivityPolicyFilter::setActiveSubjects() when called with null objects.
    - Fixed bug in Observer::importXML() where it could have passed invalid active subjects to activity policy filters if installed.
    - Fixed bugs in Observer::attachSubjects() and Observer::detachSubjects() where the Observer::numberOfSubjectsChanged() signal was emitted incorrectly.
    - Fixed bug in Context Manager where it would have registered invalid contexts in some cases.
    - Fixed bugs related to event filtering and property change event delivery in Observer.

    ============================
    QtilitiesCoreGui:
    ============================
    Improvements and Notable Changes:
    - The dependency on the Qt Solutions Property Browser is now off by default.
    - QShortcut's can now be registered in and managed by the Action Manager.
    - QtilitiesMainWindow and Mode Management
        - QtilitiesMainWindow: Handles priority message timeouts better. Previously if multiple priority messages were logged directly after one another the timeout of the first message that was logged would hide & clear the priority message in the statusbar. Now the last message will do this.
        - QtilitiesMainWindow can now be used even if your application does not use application modes.
        - Application modes can now be listed in four positions in QtilitiesMainWindow: left, top, right and bottom.
        - The list of application modes are now styled nicely and the layout bugs present in previous version have been resolved.
        - Shortcuts are now assigned to application modes.
        - The order in which application modes must appear can now be specified.
        - It is now possible to disable/enabled modes easily.
        - Active mode selection was improved.
        - IMode interface is now easier to implement. Mode IDs can now be auto generated by the mode manager and modes without contexts associated with them can now be
        - A custom mode icon can now be set if modes allow it. The session log mode in the session log plugin now allows this.created. The documentation of the IMode interface was improved to properly explain these changes and the interface's functions were renamed to more meaningfull equivalents.
        - IMode got two new functions: aboutToBeActivated() and justActivated().
        - QtilitiesMainWindow now uses scaled down icons (12x12) for priority messages which does not cause the status bar to change height anymore.
        - QtilitiesMainWindow now shows a success icon for messages starting with "Successfully" or any translation of it.
    - Tree Building Classes
        - TreeFileItem was almost rewritten from scratch and it now uses the new QtilitiesCore::QtilitiesFileInfo class at its core.
        - TreeNode got new functions to easily set up a SubjectTypeFilter on itself. This allows observer widgets to use meaningfull text in the name column's header. The ObserverTreeModel now respects this as well, previously only table models did.
        - TreeNode::enabledNamingControl() got a new parameter to set up the invalid resolution policy.
        - TreeItem::setCategorizedDisplayEnabled() replaced by enableCategorizedDisplay() and disableCategorizedDisplay().
        - AbstractTreeItem got new getCategoryString() and setCategoryString() functions. This allows categories of items to be set easily using Q_PROPERTY access.
        - TreeFileItem XML import & export methods are now virtual.
    - Observer Widgets & Observer Models
        - ObserverWidget handles ObserverHints::DisplayFlags better. It will not reconstruct toolbars everytime if the activeHints()'s display flags did not change. This could have caused the order of toolbars to change when it shouldn't.
        - ObserverWidget in table mode now resize all rows to contents every time that new items are added, previously this only happened when the widget's observer context changed.
        - Important: The complete thinking behind the way helper functions were used in observer models were abandoned. Thus, AbstractObserverTableModel is now just ObserverTableModel and AbstractObserverTreeModel is now just ObserverTreeModel. In custom observer models, you should now inherit from either ObserverTableModel or ObserverTreeModel and just call the AbstractItemModel's virtual functions rather than calling the virtual functions which was needed previously.
        - ObserverWidgets are smarter when they remove objects. They will now select the item before the item which was deleted.
        - ObserverWidget::selectObjects() now correctly refreshes the property editor if it exists.
        - ObserverWidget's functions related to selection manipulation are now virtual.
        - ObserverWidget does not allow selections with categories to be deleted anymore. This cause unpredictable results in previous versions.
        - ObserverWidget::selectObjects() now clears the current selection when getting an empty list.
        - ObserverWidget got new setCustomTableProxyModel() and setCustomTreeProxyModel() functions allowing custom proxy models to be used.
        - ObserverTreeModelProxyFilter and ObserverTableModelCategoryFilter can now be subclassed.
    - Widgets
        - ObjectPropertyBrowser got a new refresh() function to refresh the displayed properties.
        - SideViewerWidgetHelper is now called SideViewerWidgetFactory
        - ConfigurationWidget now sorts config pages and figures out the max sizes of all pages and resizes itself according to this when constructed.
        - ConfigurationWidget has new setApplyAllPages() function which allows the 'Apply' button to apply changes on all pages, not just the current one.
        - ConfigurationWidget and ModeManager will now search for and register all config pages and modes found in the global object pool by just calling initialize() on them.
        - ConfigurationWidget and AboutWindow will now close when you close an application while they are still open and the application will actually close.
        - SideWidgetFileSystem has a new button to change to the parent directory and the browse button got an icon.
        - SearchBoxWidget now allows the hide button to either be an Up or a Down arrow.
    - Interafaces
        - IActionProvider got new findActionByText() and findActionByObjectName() functions. ActionManager::registerAction() now sets the backend action's name to the ID used to register it. Thus the findActionByObjectName() will be able to find actions by their IDs, for example in ObserverWidget.
    - Naming Policy Subject Filter
        - NamingPolicyFilter: made generateValidName() and setConflictingObject() public.
        - The default validator regular expression used for NamingPolicyFilter was changed to allow 256 characters by default.
        - NamingPolicyFilter::evaluateName() got a new parameter which contains a reference to the current object whose name is being evaluated in the contexts. In some cases during subclassing NamingPolicyFilter this is usefull, in others the default parameter can just be used.
    - General
        - When CONTEXT_MANAGER->registerContext() is called with a context which already exists, the ID of the context is returned, not -1 as in previous versions.
        - QtilitiesApplication::initialize() important doc update and QtilitiesApplication::aboutQtilities() changed so that it returns the constructed about window.
        - New information icon.

    Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed crash in NamingPolicyFilter::setValidator() if the filter did not have an observer context.
    - Fixed bug in observer widget where it disabled all actions in its action provider when the current context was deleted, and then never enabled all of them again. This for example caused the refreshView action to become disabled sometimes.
    - Fixed memory leak in ActionContainer destructor.
    - Fixed memory leak in CodeEditorWidget's destructor.
    - Fixed memory leak in CommandEditor.
    - Fixed memory leaks in ObserverWidget.
    - Fixed bug in ObserverTreeModel where the local selection parent's display hints was used even if AbstractObserverItemModel::useObserverHints() was false.
    - Fixed bug where AbstractTreeItem::setCategory() would not have changed the items modification state correctly.
    - Fixed ModeListWidget layout bug in QtilitiesMainWindow.
    - ModeListWidget does not allow users to move mode icons anymore.
    - Fixed bug in ObserverWidget::contextDeleted() where the function attempted to set the observer context to an invalid context in some scenarios.
    - Fixed crash in AbstractTreeItem::setName() when it had no parent.
    - Fixed bug in ObjectPropertyBrowser where it would have crashes after trying to edit a property of the object after the object was deleted. The properties are now removed when the object is deleted.
    - Fixed bug where TreeNode::setCategorizedDisplayEnabled(false) would not have worked.
    - Fixed bug in CodeEditorWidgetConfig constructor where window flags was not passed to base QWidget class correctly.
    - Fixed inconsistancy in number of spaces added to command tooltips with shortcuts.
    - Fixed bug where some needed functions were private on ObjectScopeWidget. They are now public.
    - Fixed possible crash in CommandEditor.

    ============================
    QtilitiesExtensionSystem:
    ============================
    New Features and Notable Changes:
    - Extension system now has the ability to create and load plugin loading configuration sets:
        - Plugin classification added (active, inactive, filtered and core plugins)
        - Plugin loading and initialization changed to handle plugins depending on their classification.
        - XML plugin configuration file support.
        - GUI control over active configuration sets and indication of core plugins.
        - The debug plugin now provides information about loaded plugin configuration sets and the ability to create custom plugin configurations.
        - See the updated Extension System Overview documentation for more information.
    - The extension system now filters all version specific shared object files (for example .so.1) when loading plugins.
    - The extension system got a new findPlugin() method which can be used to find a plugin interface using its IPlugin::pluginName().
    - Removed event filter from the observer managing plugins. This allows plugins to be moved to threads other than the main thread.
    - Added documentation related to the extension system and threading to the ExtensionSystemCore::initialize() function documentation.

    Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed memory leak in ExtensionSystemCore.

    ============================
    QtilitiesProjectManagement:
    ============================
    Improvements and Notable Changes:
    - The project manager got projectLoadingStarted() and projectLoadingFinished() signals.
    - ProjectManager::initialize() improved.

    Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed memory leak in ProjectManager.

    ============================
    Plugins and Examples:
    ============================
    Improvements and Notable Changes:
    - Much improved Debug Plugin:
        - Automatically refreshes now everytime you swith to the Debug mode.
        - New application state tab that gives runtime information about Application Modes, Contexts, Action, Factories etc.
        - The global object pool view was improved and now has an ObjectScopeWidget next to it which gets updated when your selection changes.
        - A new "Plugin Management" tab which allows you to view, manage and create new plugin configuration sets.
    - Changed project management plugin's default shortcuts to use the standard ones defined in QKeySequence.

    Bug Fixes:
    - Fixes issue where multiple spaces were added between the application name and the project name when closing/opening project alot.


================================
Qtilities v0.2
================================
- Big updates to the following documentation pages:
  - Logging
  - Extension System
  - Tree Building
  - Factories
  - Observer Widgets
  - As always many many small doc updates everywhere in the API.
- Categories:
  - Qtilities uses the concept of categories in many places. For example you can add objects to an observer in different categories, or when you register a factory interface in a factory you can assign a category to it. Previously categories were defined as QStringList in some places and QString in other places. To make things consistent a new class called QtilitiesCategory was created and all the places where categories are used now uses this class.
  - ActionProvider was optimized and uses the new QtilitiesCategory class for its categories.
  - FactoryInterfaceData struct now called FactoryInterfaceTag which also uses the new QtilitiesCategory class to categorize factory interfaces.
- Tree Building:
  - New classes was added to make tree building very very easy. The classes are TreeNode, TreeItem, TreeFileItem and couple of classes doing work in the background: AbstractTreeItem and TreeItemBase. The building trees documentation was rewritten and shows how the new classes can be used.
  - XML exporting and importing was implemented for tree structures. You can now save a tree to a XML file and load it again from the file at a later stage.
- Binary Exporting:
  - ObserverHints now provides function to change its exportability. That is, the hints are not part of observer exports by default anymore.
  - Since binary exporting exports all observer properties on an object, the formatting properties of tree items (defined in the new AbstractTreeItem class) are now part of binary exports as well.
- Object Manager & Factories:
  - The object manager now contains a QObject based factory, called the Qtilities factory. This factory can be used to produce Qtilities classes such as tree nodes, tree items, observers, subject filters etc. It can also be used to register and produce custom QObject based user classes.
  - Factory classes was updated and better documented. Important changes: 
    - IFactoryData is now called InstanceFactoryInfo
    - IFactory is now called IFactoryProvider.
    - FactoryData is now called FactoryItemID
  - The object manager got extra functions to make working with factories easier.
  - The global object pool is now accessible. All Qtilities classes now registers objects in proper categories thus you can debug your global object pool by looking at it using an observer widget.
- Observer Widgets and Models. 
  - The big change is that, when in TreeView mode, the tree does not lose its selection when the observer tree is modified or when the user modified the tree using the ObserverWidget actions (Delete Item, Switch View etc.). 
  - Drag & Drop in both TreeView and TableView modes are now supported. It is controlled by the ObserverHints::DragDropHint set on the different observers in the tree. ObserverHints got a new hint called DragDropHint which can be used to control drag drop operations on observer trees.
  - Access functions for the table and tree views are now provided.
  - Actions are added to the SearchBoxWidget to allow control over which items in a tree must be filtered by the search string (See the next point).
  - Icons used are much better and nicer, fixed many bugs with custom action handlers, and the enabled state of actions.
  - Many problems fixed related to deletion of the current context and setting a new context after that.
  - Category access modes are now shown in the access column, and locked access categories are not built in tree views.
  - New class AbstractObserverTreeProxyFilter was added and is integrated into ObserverWidget. This allows searching of trees to be more effective. You can now choose what the filter must be applied to: Nodes, Items, Categories.
- The ConfigurationWidget was improved a lot: 
  - You can now show the config pages as a tree or a list.
  - The pages can now be searched.
  - All config pages which are part of Qtilities now provide proper icons.
  - The icon of the page is now shown along with the name of the active page above the config page widget.
  - QtilitiesApplication now stores a reference to the configuration page. This allows it to be accessed from anywhere in the application. 
  - A new setActivePage() method was added. Thus it is now possible to show a specific page directly. A Logging Settings action as added to the WidgetLoggerEngineFrontend widget which uses this approach to open the log settings.
- The SearchBoxWidget was improved. It is now easy to add more search options to the search options popup menu.
- Project management got some major improvements:
  - There was multiple problems when using more than one project part in an application. These are fixed.
  - The project manager now support saving of XML project files in addition to the binary projects and it is possible to specify which project types (XML and/or binary) should be available to the user, and which project type should be used a the default in an application.
  - A few convenience functions have been added to the ProjectManager to make working with different project types easier. See the class documentation for details.
  - The project manager now has a configuration option to use a custom projects path.
  - It is now possible to control the verbosity of logging and testing done during saving and loading of projects. 
- Extension System:
  - Plugins can now be loaded from custom paths.
  - The plugin configuration dialog got a major overhaul and looks and works much better especially in applications which has many plugins.
  - IPlugin improved: It does not inherit QObject anymore making it very lightweigth and any QObject based class can now implement it. It also contains new functions such as the pluginName(), pluginCategory() and pluginFileName().
  - Plugins which are independent of the application they are used can now be created. All Qtilities plugins are now created in this way.
  - Plugins:
    - A new Debug plugin which allows debugging of Qtilities is now included. This plugin allows debugging by providing an overview of the state of the global object pool at any moment, as well as the available factories registered with the object manager.The plugin will get more useful features like a list of registered contexts in the future.
- Logging:
  - The logger now supports priority messages and the QtilitiesMainWindow can be enabled/disabled to show priority messages in its status bar.
- Observers & Subject Filters:
  - attachSubject(s) and canAttach() functions got a new rejection/error message string parameter which is set with a rejection message when the attachment fails. canAttach() also got a parameter to indicate if the attachment must be silent or not (no dialogs shown).
  - NamingPolicyFilter can now be subclassed properly to create custom naming filters.
  - Many other improvements and updates to observers and subject filters.
- Building and Using Qtilities:
  - Qtilities was built using MS Visual Studio 2008 on Windows 7. This required many many small changes to the codebase which otherwise built on Ubuntu (g++) and Windows (mingw). Some testing was done using this build but everything was not tested. Some problems related to template classes (factories etc.) were experienced after the build was done and the headers were included in a different project. These were not fixed for this release. If you stumble upon it and know a fix, please contribute it.
  - New QTILITIES_NO_PROPERTY_BROWSER variable in Qtilities.pri which can be set to build Qtilities without the Qt Property Browser Solution as a dependency.
  - Namespaces in Qtilities are now easier to use. Previously it was necessary to call "use namespace" on the module used and its dependencies. Now you can just call it once on the module you are using.
- Many bug fixes and enhancements apart from the once which were fixed on the issue tracker.
