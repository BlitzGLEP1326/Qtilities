/**\page page_factories Factories: Creating and managing factories
\section factories_overview OverviewThe C++ factory pattern is a powerful tool which can be used to create objects using only a tag such as a string. The Qtilitieslibraries provides an advanced factory pattern implementation which allows the developer to create multiple factories in an application, to manage the factories and to allow any QObject based object to be create by a factory.Table of contents:- \ref creating_factories- \ref managing_factories- \ref used_during_importing\section creating_factories Creating factoriesThe Qtilities::Core::Factory class is a template based Qt implementation of the factory programming pattern. The class allowsyou to register factory interfaces, defined by the Qtilities::Core::FactoryInterface class, where each interface is defined bya tag in the form of a QString. New instances of factory items (defined by Qtilities::Core::FactoryItem) can then be createdby only providing the factory with the needed interface tag.The factory implementation is best described by an example. In the example we have a base class ExampleBase whichis the base class used by the factory. ProduceMe is the class which is registered in the factory. The factoryis able to generate instances of ProduceMe .The following goes into your header file, lets say ProduceMe.h:\code#include <QtilitiesCore>using namespace QtilitiesCore;// Base classclass ExampleBase {    ExampleBase() {}    virtual ~ExampleBase() {}}// ProduceMe class derived from ExampleBaseclass ProduceMe : public ExampleBase {    ProduceMe() {}    ~ProduceMe() {}    // Make this class a factory item    static FactoryItem<ExampleBase, ProduceMe> factory;}\endcodeThe following goes into ProduceMe.cpp:\codeFactoryItem<ExampleBase, ProduceMe> ProduceMe::factory;\endcodeYou can now produce instances of the ProduceMe class as follows:\code#include "ProduceMe.h"#include <QtilitiesCore>using namespace QtilitiesCore;Factory<ExampleBase> exampleFactory;FactoryInterfaceData example_iface_data("Example Tag",QStringList(),QStringList());exampleFactory.registerFactoryInterface(&ProduceMe::factory,example_iface_data);// We can create instances of ProduceMe as follow:ExampleBase* base_inst = exampleFactory.createInstance("ExampleTag");ProduceMe* produceMe_inst = qobject_cast<ProduceMe*> (base_inst);\endcode\section managing_factories Managing factoriesAs an application gets bigger there is often a need for multiple factories. The Qtilities::Core::ObjectManager class can manage multiple factories within an application. To use this functionality you can register different Qtilities::Core::Interfaces::IFactory interfaces in the object manager through the Qtilities::Core::Interfaces::IObjectManager::registerIFactory() method. A reference to any factory can be obtained through the Qtilities::Core::Interfaces::IObjectManager::factoryReference() method.\section used_during_importing Using factories during import/export operationsThis section will be added in a future release.*/
