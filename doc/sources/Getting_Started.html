\section getting_sources Getting the sourcesThe project source files is hosted using the Git version control system on www.gitorious.com.\section building_qtilities Building Qtilities\subsection getting_started_library_dependencies DependenciesThe %Qtilities CoreGui module depends on the <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products/appdev/add-on-products/catalog/4/Widgets/qtpropertybrowser/">Qt Property Browser Solution</a> which needs to be built before building this module. The src/Qtilities.pri file defines the \p QTILITIES_DEPENDENCIES variable which must point to the directory in which you extract the property browser solution. The exact libraries path that is expected under this folder is defined in the project file of the CoreGui module, and is \p qtpropertybrowser-2.5-opensource/lib by default. The \p qtpropertybrowser-2.5-opensource/src folder is added to the include path by default.For Windows 32-bit users, a ready to use archive containing the dependency can be downloaded <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qtilities/downloads/detail?name=qtpropertybrowser-2.5-opensource.zip&can=2&q=">here</a>. To use the package, create a /dependency directory in your qtilities root path and extract the archive directly into this folder.\subsection build_instructions Build instructionsTo build %Qtilities, follow these steps:- Build the required dependencies.- Get the sources, either by cloning the Git repository, or by downloading the sources.- Open the src/Qtilities.pro project in your IDE. You will see the %Qtilities project with the list of modules underneath it.- Open the src/Qtilities.pri file and change the following variables to match your environment:	- \p QTILITIES_BASE: Set this to the base directory where you checked out or extracted the sources.	- \p BUILD_MODE: Set this to either release or debug depending on the release mode you want to follow. - You are now ready to build the modules. The output files are placed under the bin folder.  \subsection output_file_names Output file namesAll library file names, and the names of all example projects has the \p QTILITIES_FILE_VER variable appended to it. The format is as follows: -0.1.b1, meaning major version 0, minor version 1, beta version 1. Alpha versions will have an \p a character appended in the place of the \p b.When you build the libraries in debug mode, a small letter \d character is appended to all library names. In release mode this character is removed.\subsection tested_environments Tested environmentsAt present the libraries have been tested on the following setup:- Windows XP 32bit- Qt Creator- MingW compiler.- Qt 4.6.3More testing is on the project's roadmap.\subsection examples_project Building the examples%Qtilities comes with a set of examples which provides demonstrations of different features. The src/Examples/QtilitiesExamples.pro project can be opened and used to build the examples. The examples are placed in the bin/Examples output folder.\subsection plugins_project Building the plugins%Qtilities comes with a set of plugins which can be used in any application using the %Qtilities Extension System. The src/Plugins/QtilitiesPlugins.pro project can be opened and used to build the plugins. The plugins are placed in the bin/Plugins output folder.\section using_qtilities Using Qtilities in a projectIt is very easy to use the %Qtilities libraries in a project. All you need to do is to specify the module you want to use and then include the src/Qtilities.pri in your .pro file. You must of course first build Qtilities and you must make sure that you've updated the src/Qtilities.pri file to point to your correct paths as described in \ref building_qtilities.\codeQTILITIES += extension_systeminclude(../../Qtilities.pri)\endcodeWhen you include a library in your .pro file, all dependant libraries are automatically included as well. For an overview of the library dependencies on each other, see \ref library_dependencies. */
