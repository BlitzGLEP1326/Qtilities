\section getting_sources Getting the sourcesThe project sources are hosted using the Git version control system on http://www.gitorious.org. The project can be accessed directly at http://gitorious.org/qtilities.If you want to get the version controlled sources and you are not familiar with Git, see the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">Git User Manual</a> first. To clone the repository you can use the following command. The master branch host the current development snapshot and it is recommended to use a stable branch for your development.\codegit clone git://gitorious.org/qtilities/qtilities.git qtilitiescd qtilities\endcodeYou can also get an archive any development branch by browsing the source tree on Gitorious and selecting the archive download link. Alternatively, you can also download stable release archives from the <a href="http:\\code.google.com\p\qtilities\downloads\list">Qtilities download page</a>.\section tested_environments Tested environmentsAt present the libraries have been tested on the following setups:- Qt 4.6.2 / Windows XP / Mingw32- Qt 4.6.2 / Linux (Ubuntu 10.04 LTS x64) / g++Although %Qtilities have only been tested with Qt 4.6, it should work with Qt 4.x.\section building_qtilities Building QtilitiesThis section will guide you through the process of building %Qtilities. \subsection getting_started_library_dependencies DependenciesFor an overview of the library dependencies on each other, see \ref library_dependencies first. The %Qtilities CoreGui module depends on the <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products/appdev/add-on-products/catalog/4/Widgets/qtpropertybrowser/">Qt Property Browser Solution</a> which needs to be built before building this module. The src/Qtilities.pri file defines the \p QTILITIES_DEPENDENCIES variable which must point to the directory in which you extract the property browser solution. The exact libraries path that is expected under this folder is defined in the project file of the CoreGui module, and is \p qtpropertybrowser-2.5-opensource/lib by default. The \p qtpropertybrowser-2.5-opensource/src folder is added to the include path by default.For Windows users, a ready to use archive containing the dependency can be downloaded <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qtilities/downloads/detail?name=qtpropertybrowser-2.5-opensource.zip&can=2&q=">here</a>. To use the package, create a /dependency directory in your qtilities root path and extract the archive directly into this folder. The build was done using Qt 4.6.2 / Windows XP / Mingw32.\subsection build_windows Building on WindowsTo build %Qtilities on Windows, follow these steps:- Get and build the required dependencies.- Get the sources, either by cloning the Git repository, or by downloading them directly. See \ref gettings_sources for more information.- Open the src/Qtilities.pro project in your IDE. You will see the %Qtilities project with the list of modules underneath it.- If you want to build the examples and plugins as well, open the src/Examples/QtilitiesExamples.pro and src/Plugins/QtilitiesPlugins.pro projects as well. QtilitiesPlugins depends on %Qtilities, and QtilitiesExamples depends on both %Qtilities and QtilitiesPlugins.- Open the src/Qtilities.pri file and change the \p QTILITIES_BASE variable to match the base directory where you checked out or extracted the sources. This is the directory which contains src, dependencies, lib, include etc. For example: \p C:\Projects\Qt\Qtilities- You are now ready to build the modules. The output files are placed under the bin folder. See the \output_file_names section for more details on the output file name format.- When the modules are built you are ready to use %Qtilities. Make sure you set your PATH environment variable to include the /bin, /bin/plugins and /dependencies/qtpropertybrowser-2.5-opensource/lib folders. If they are not included, you will get errors when you run any %Qtilities application.\subsection build_linux Building on LinuxTo build %Qtilities on Linux, follow these steps:- Get and build the required dependencies.- Get the sources, either by cloning the Git repository, or by downloading them directly. See \ref gettings_sources for more information.- Open the src/Qtilities.pro project in your IDE. You will see the %Qtilities project with the list of modules underneath it.- If you want to build the examples and plugins as well, open the src/Examples/QtilitiesExamples.pro and src/Plugins/QtilitiesPlugins.pro projects as well. QtilitiesPlugins depends on %Qtilities, and QtilitiesExamples depends on both %Qtilities and QtilitiesPlugins. - Open the src/Qtilities.pri file and change the \p QTILITIES_BASE variable to match the base directory where you checked out or extracted the sources. This is the directory which contains src, dependencies, lib, include etc. For example: \p /home/MyUserName/Projects/Qt/Qtilities- You are now ready to build the modules. The output files are placed under the bin folder. See the \output_file_names section for more details on the output file name format.- When the modules are built you are ready to use %Qtilities. Make sure the libraries can be found by any applications. The simplest way to do this is to copy all the output .so files (all in /bin, /bin/plugins and /dependencies/qtpropertybrowser-2.5-opensource/lib) to the /user/lib directory.\subsection output_file_names Output file namesAll library file names, and the names of all example projects has the \p QTILITIES_FILE_VER variable appended to it. The format is as follows: -0.1.b1, meaning major version 0, minor version 1, beta version 1. Alpha versions will have an \p a character appended in the place of the \p b.When you build the libraries in debug mode, a small letter \d character is appended to all library names. In release mode this character is removed.\section whats_next It Built, What Now?The following two articles is a good place to start:- \ref page_the_basics- \ref page_examples_and_plugins */
