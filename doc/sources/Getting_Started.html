\section getting_sources Getting the sourcesThe project source files is hosted using the Git version control system on www.gitorious.com.\section building_qtilities Building QtilitiesTo build %Qtilities, follow these steps:- Get the sources, either by cloning the Git repository, or by downloading the sources.- Open the src/Qtilities.pro project in your IDE. You will see the %Qtilities project with the list of modules underneath it.- Open the src/Qtilities.pri file and change the following variables to match your environment:	- \p QTILITIES_BASE: Set this to the base directory where you checked out or extracted the sources.	- \p BUILD_MODE: Set this to either release or debug depending on the release mode you want to follow. - You are now ready to build the modules. The output files are placed under the bin folder.  \subsection output_file_names Output file namesAll library file names, and the names of all example projects has the \p QTILITIES_FILE_VER variable appended to it. The format is as follows: _v0_1_b1, meaning major version 0, minor version 1, beta version 1. Alpha versions will have an \p a character appended in the place of the \p b.When you build the libraries in debug mode, a small letter \d character is appended to all library names. In release mode this character is removed.\subsection tested_environments Tested environmentsAt present the libraries have been tested on the following setup:- Windows XP 32bit- Qt Creator- MingW compiler.- Qt 4.6.3More testing is on the project's roadmap.\subsection examples_project Building the examples%Qtilities comes with a set of examples which provides demonstrations of different features. The src/Examples/QtilitiesExamples.pro project can be opened and used to build the examples. The examples are placed in the bin/Examples output folder.\section using_qtilities Using Qtilities in a projectIt is very easy to use the %Qtilities libraries in a project. All you need to do is to specify the module you want to use and then include the src/Qtilities.pri in your .pro file. You must of course first build Qtilities and you must make sure that you've updated the src/Qtilities.pri file to point to your correct paths as described in \ref building_qtilities.\codeQTILITIES += extension_systeminclude(../../Qtilities.pri)\endcodeWhen you include a library in your .pro file, all dependant libraries are automatically included as well. For an overview of the library dependencies on each other, see \ref library_dependencies. */
