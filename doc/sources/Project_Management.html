Projects forms a vital part of most software packages. It allows the user to save the current state of an application to a file and later restore the state of the application from the saved state. %Qtilities provides a library dedicated to project management which can easily be added to any Qt application.

\section project_structure The structure of a Qtilities project

A project is a class which implements the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::Interfaces::IProject interface. Each project can consist of any number of project items. Project items are classes which implement the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::Interfaces::IProjectItem interface. The Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager singleton is responsible to manage open projects. At present only one project can be open (active) at any time. 

The diagram below shows this structure graphically.

\section project_management_first_steps First steps: Setting up the project manager

\subsection initialize_finalize Initializing and finalizing the project manager
The project manager provides macros to initialize it on application startup and to finalize the manager when the application exists. During initialization the project manager will restore its settings from the previous session and load the last project if needed, or create a new project if needed. The finalization does the opposite: it saves the current settings and checks if the open project (if any) must be saved before exit. Lets look at the correct way to initialize and finalize the project manager:

\code
#include <QtilitiesProjectManagement>
using namespace Qtilities::CoreGui;
using namespace Qtilities::ProjectManagement;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  QtilitiesApplication a(argc, argv);   

  // Add project items in the application to the project manager.

  // Initialize the project manager:
  PROJECT_MANAGER_INITIALIZE();

  // Register project management config page. If the configuration widget is used in the application this is needed, if not you can skip this line.
  OBJECT_MANAGER->registerObject(ProjectManager::instance()->configWidget());

  int result = a.exec();
  PROJECT_MANAGER_FINALIZE();
  return results;
}
\endcode

\subsection project_items Registering project items in the project manager

Project items must be added to the project manager before initialization. When the project manager creates a new project it will attach all known project items to the project. The recommended way to do this is to register all your project items in the global object pool (see \ref page_object_management for more information on this topic) and then get all the project items once the application is stable (all plugins were initialized etc.). When using the Qtilities::Plugins::ProjectManagement plugin in the \p QtilitiesPlugins project this will be done automatically when the plugin initializes its dependencies. Alternatively when not using the plugin, \p PROJECT_MANAGER->refreshPartList() can be used to inspect the object pool.

\subsection project_file_version Project file type and version

The project manager is able to save projects in either binary or xml format where file extensions used for both project types are defined by Qtilities::ProjectManagement::Constants::qti_def_SUFFIX_PROJECT_BINARY and Qtilities::ProjectManagement::Constants::qti_def_SUFFIX_PROJECT_XML. It is possible to specify which project file types are allowed in an application using Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::setAllowedProjectTypes() and a default type can be set for cases for multiple types are allowed using Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::setDefaultProjectType(). See the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager documentation for more details about the functions available to work with different kind of projects.

It is important to set the version of the project files generated whenever you change the structure of the exported file. When the project file format is binary, the project manager must know exactly what the project file is going to look like. Binary project files starts with a quint32 value representing the %Qtilities Libraries export version followed by a quint32 Project File version which is set using this function. When you attempt to open a project which was saved in a different version of the %Qtilities Libraries (in which the export version was different) or a different project file version the open attempt will fail. 

See Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::setProjectFileVersion() for more information.

\section using_projects Projects in action: Using projects in your application

\subsection working_with_projects Working with projects (creating, saving and loading)

The project manager can manage one open project at a time, accessible through Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::currentProject(). If no project is open, a new project can be created using Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::newProject(). This function can also be used to create a new project, thus closing and prompting to save the current project (if necessary) and creating a new project. If the current project
must be closed without creating a new project call the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::closeProject() function. 

To save the current project call the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::saveProject() function. The file name of the current project can be obtained through the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::currentProjectFileName() function.

The project manager keeps a list of recent projects accessible through Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::recentProjectPaths(), or Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::recentProjectNames(). A mapping to a recent project file path from the recent project name can be done through Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::recentProjectPath(). The list of recent projects can be cleared using Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::clearRecentProjects(). 

The project manager implements the Qtilities::Core::Interfaces::IModificationNotifier interface which can be used directly to control the modification state of the open project in the project manager.

All the project management configuration options can be accessed directly through the project manager which provides getter and setter functions for all the available options. 

\subsection project_options Project management options

The project manager provides various options on how projects must be managed. See the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager class documentation for the access functions of these options. The screen shot below (taken from the \p ObjectManagementExample) shows the available settings in the project management configuration dialog:

\image latex project_configuration_widget.eps "Project Management Configuration Widget" width=\textwidth

\subsection observer_project_items Adding observers as project items

The Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ObserverProjectItemWrapper class provides a wrapper which can be used to add an observer (tree) as a project item in your application.
Below is an example which shows how to use this wrapper.

\code
Observer* observerA = new Observer("Observer A","Example observer");
ObserverProjectItemWrapper* project_item = new ObserverProjectItemWrapper(this);
project_item->setObserverContext(observerA);
OBJECT_MANAGER->registerObject(project_item);
\endcode

\subsection project_management_plugin The example project management plugin

In the \p QtilitiesExamples project there is a project management plugin which can be built against your application (this is necessary for the plugin to know which version of the application must be used during plugin compatibility checking). For more information see the \ref plugins_overview section of the \ref page_examples_and_plugins page.
