/**\page page_project_management Adding project management functionality to your applications
\section project_management_overview OverviewProjects forms a vital part of most software packages. It allows the user to save the current state of an application to a file and later restore the state of the application to the saved state. Qtilities provides a library dedicated to project management whichcan easily be added to any Qt application.Table of contents:- \ref project_structure- \ref project_management_first_steps	- \ref initialize_finalize	- \ref project_items	- \ref project_file_version	.- \ref using_projects	- \ref working_with_projects	- \ref project_options	- \ref observer_project_items	- \ref project_management_plugin	.\section project_structure The structure of a Qtilities projectA project is a class which implements the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::Interfaces::IProject interface. Each project can consist of any number of project items. Project items are classes which implements the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::Interfaces::IProjectItem interface. The Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager singleton is responsible to manage open projects. At present only one project can beopen (active) at any time. The diagram below shows this structure graphically.\image html project_structure.jpg "Project Structure"\image latex project_structure.eps "Project Structure" width=5in\section project_management_first_steps First steps: Setting up the project manager\subsection initialize_finalize Initializing and finalizing the project managerThe project manager provides macros to initialize it on application startup and to finalize the manager when the application exists. Duringinitialization the project manager will restore its settings from the previous session and load the last project if needed, or create a newproject if needed. The finalization does the opposite: it saves the current settings and checks if the open project (if any) must be savedbefore exit. Lets look at the correct way to initialize and finalize the project manager:\code#include <ProjectManagementConfig.h>#include <ProjectManager.h>using namespace Qtilities::ProjectManagement;int main(int argc, char *argv[]){	QApplication a(argc, argv);   	// Add project items in the application to the project manager.	// Initialize the project manager:	PROJECT_MANAGER_INITIALIZE();	// Register project management config page. If the configuration widget is used in the application this is needed, if not you can 	// skip this line.	QtilitiesCore::instance()->objectManager()->registerObject(ProjectManager::instance()->configWidget());	int result = a.exec();	PROJECT_MANAGER_FINALIZE();	return results;}\endcode\subsection project_items Registering project items in the project managerProject items must be added to the project manager before initialization. When the project manager creates a new project it will attach all known project items to the project. The recommended way to do this is to register allyour project items in the global object pool (see <a href="page_object_management.html">Object management using the global object pool and the object manager</a>for more information on this topic) and then get all the project items once the application is stable (all plugins were initialized etc.). Here is an example of how you can get all the project items in the global object pool and then register them in the project manager. \code#include <QtilitiesCore.h>#include <IObjectManager.h>#include <Logger.h>using namespace Qtilities::Core;// Get a list of all the project items in the system.QList<QObject*> projectItemObjects = QtilitiesCore::instance()->objectManager()->registeredInterfaces("IProjectItem");QList<IProjectItem*> projectItems;QStringList itemNames;bool success = true;// Check all itemsfor (int i = 0; i < projectItemObjects.count(); i++) {	IProjectItem* part = qobject_cast<IProjectItem*> (projectItemObjects.at(i));	if (part) {		if (!itemNames.contains(part->projectItemName())) {			projectItems.append(part);			LOG_INFO(QString(tr("Project Manager: Found project item: %1")).arg(part->projectItemName()));		} else {			LOG_ERROR(tr("The project manager found duplicate project items called: ") + part->projectItemName() + tr(", the second occurance is on object: ") + projectItemObjects.at(i)->objectName());			success = false;		}	} else {		LOG_ERROR(tr("The project manager found in invalid project item interface on object: ") + projectItemObjects.at(i)->objectName());		success = false;	}}PROJECT_MANAGER->setProjectItemList(projectItems);\endcode\subsection project_file_version Project file versionIt is important to set the version of the project files generated whenever you change the structure of the exported file. Since the project files are binary the project manager must know exactly what the project file is going to look like. Each project file starts with the a quint32 value representing the %Qtilities Libraries export version followed by a quint32 Project File version which is set using this function. When you attempt to open a project which was saved in a different version of the %Qtilities Libraries (in which the export version was different) or a different project file version the open attempt will fail. See the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::setProjectFileVersion() for more information.\section using_projects Projects in action: Using projects in your application\subsection working_with_projects Working with projects (creating, saving and loading)The project manager can manage one open project at a time, accessible through Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::currentProject(). If no project is open, a new project can be created using Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::newProject(). This function can also be used when to create a new project, thus closing the current project and creating a new project. If the current projectmust be closed without creating a new project call the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::closeProject() function. To save the current project call the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::saveProject() function. The file name of the current project can be obtained through the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::currentProjectFileName() function.The project manager keeps a list of recent projects accessible through Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::recentProjectPaths(), or Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::recentProjectNames(). A mapping to a recent project file path from the recent project name can be done through Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::recentProjectPath(). The list of recent projects can be cleared using Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager::clearRecentProjects(). The project manager implements the Qtilities::Core::Interfaces::IModificationNotifier interface which can be used directly to control the modification state of the open projects in the project manager (which can only be one at present).All the project management configuration options can be access directly through the project manager which provides getter and setter functions for all the available options. \subsection project_options Project management optionsThe project manager provides various options on how projects must be managed. See the Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ProjectManager class documentation for the access functions of these options. The screen shot below (taken from the Object Management Example) shows the available settings in the project management configuration dialog:\image html project_configuration_widget.jpg "Project Management Configuration Widget"\image latex project_configuration_widget.eps "Project Management Configuration Widget" width=\textwidth\subsection observer_project_items Adding observers as project itemsThe Qtilities::ProjectManagement::ObserverProjectItemWrapper class provides a wrapper which can be used to add an observer (tree) as a project item in your application.Below is an example which shows how to use this wrapper.\codeObserver* observerA = new Observer("Observer A","Example observer");ObserverProjectItemWrapper* project_item = new ObserverProjectItemWrapper(this);project_item->setObserverContext(observerA);QtilitiesCore::instance()->objectManager()->registerObject(project_item);\endcode\subsection project_management_plugin The example project management pluginIn the QtilitiesExamples project there is a project management plugin which can be built against your application (this is necessary for the plugin to know which version of the application must be used during plugin compatibility checking). For more information see the \ref plugins_overview section of the \ref page_examples_and_plugins page.*/
