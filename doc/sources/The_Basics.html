/**\page page_the_basics The Basics: Your First %Qtilities Application\section the_basics_overview OverviewThe goal of this article is to introduce %Qtilities to someone who has never used it before. We will cover basic principles and give an overview of the what features are found in the libraries. This article is not intended to give an overview of the different libraries, for that see the <a href="index.html">documentation home page</a>.\section simple_example A simple example applicationLets start of with a very simple application and look at it in detail. The application will do nothing usefull, it will just run and make some calls to some managers and then exit.\code#include <QtGui>#include <QtilitiesCoreGui>using namespace QtilitiesCoreGui;int main(int argc, char *argv[]){  QtilitiesApplication a(argc, argv);  QtilitiesApplication::setOrganizationName("Jaco Naude");  QtilitiesApplication::setOrganizationDomain("Qtilities");  QtilitiesApplication::setApplicationName("Simple Example");  QtilitiesApplication::setApplicationVersion("0.1");    // Create an object and register it in the global object pool.  QObject obj;  OBJECT_MANAGER->registerObject(obj);    // Create an example context and register it in the context manager.  QString my_context = "My Context";  int my_context_id = CONTEXT_MANAGER->register(my_context);    // Create an action and register it in the action manager under our context.  QAction* my_action = new QAction(QIcon(),"My Action");  my_action->setEnabled(false);  ACTION_MANAGER->registerAction("Actions.myAction",my_action,my_context_id);      // Now lets set our context active. This will enable my_action.  CONTEXT_MANAGER->setNewContext(my_context);    return 0; }\endcodeThe first thing to note about the above application is that we use Qtilities::CoreGui::QtilitiesApplication, rather than the normal QApplication class. Qtilities::CoreGui::QtilitiesApplication inherits QApplcation and adds extra functionality to it. The most important additions are references to the different managers in %Qtilities. Lets look at these managers briefly before examining the rest of the example.\subsection the_basics_object_manager The Object ManagerRest of example\subsection the_basics_context_manager The Context ManagerRest of example\subsection the_basics_action_manager The Action ManagerRest of example\subsection the_basics_clipboard_manager The Clipboard ManagerRest of exampleRest of exampleIt is not neccesarry to use the QtilitiesApplication object as shown in this example.
