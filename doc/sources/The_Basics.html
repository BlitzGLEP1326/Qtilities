\section simple_example A simple example application

Lets start of with a very simple application and look at it in detail. The application will do nothing useful, it will just run, make calls to some managers and then show a main window.

\code
#include <QtGui>
#include <QtilitiesCoreGui>
using namespace QtilitiesCoreGui;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  QtilitiesApplication a(argc, argv);
  QtilitiesApplication::setOrganizationName("Jaco Naude");
  QtilitiesApplication::setOrganizationDomain("Qtilities");
  QtilitiesApplication::setApplicationName("Simple Example");
  QtilitiesApplication::setApplicationVersion("0.1");
  
  // Create a main window for our application
  QMainWindow* mainWindow = new QMainWindow();
  QtilitiesApplication::setMainWindow(mainWindow);
  
  // Create an object and register it in the global object pool
  QObject obj;
  OBJECT_MANAGER->registerObject(&obj);
  
  // Create an example context and register it in the context manager
  QString my_context = "My Context";
  int my_context_id = CONTEXT_MANAGER->registerContext(my_context);
  QList<int> context_list;
  context_list << my_context_id;
  
  // Create an action and register it in the action manager under our context
  QAction* my_action = new QAction(QIcon(),"My Action",0);
  my_action->setEnabled(false);
  ACTION_MANAGER->registerAction("Actions.myAction",my_action,context_list);
  
  // Now lets set our context active. This will enable my_action
  CONTEXT_MANAGER->setNewContext(my_context);
  
  mainWindow->show();
  return a.exec(); 
}
\endcode

Lets look at the way \p includes and \p namespaces work in %Qtilities:

\code
// In your .pro file
QTILITIES += coregui
include(../../Qtilities.pri)

// In your .cpp file as shown in this example
#include <QtilitiesCoreGui>
using namespace QtilitiesCoreGui;
\endcode

In your .pro file you need to define the %Qtilities module you would like to use in your application. This will include all the needed header files and link your application to the correct libraries. The exact details to use for the different modules are provided in the \ref page_modules_overview article. Note that all dependent %Qtilities modules will be added automatically for you and details about the used dependencies are printed as output during compilation. For the example we gave here we set the \p QTILITIES variable to \p coregui indicating that we are using the CoreGui module, and the following will be printed during compilation.
\code
Project MESSAGE: Using Qtilities CoreGui module...
Project MESSAGE: Extension System Dependency: Using Qtilities Logging module...
Project MESSAGE: Extension System Dependency: Using Qtilities Core module...
\endcode

In the implementation (.cpp) file we need to include the name of the module and then specify the namespaces we want to use. The inclusion again include all dependent libraries. The same holds for the namespaces, thus all the required namespaces of all dependent modules will be used.

The next thing to note about the above application is that we use Qtilities::CoreGui::QtilitiesApplication, rather than the normal QApplication class. In console applications (non-gui) you should use Qtilities::Core::QtilitiesCoreApplication. Qtilities::CoreGui::QtilitiesApplication inherits QApplcation and adds extra functionality to it. The most important additions are references to the different managers in %Qtilities. Lets look at these managers briefly before examining the rest of the example.

\subsection the_basics_object_manager The Object Manager

The object manager provides object management functionality to your application. It can be accessed through the OBJECT_MANAGER macro which is basically a shortcut to QtilitiesCoreApplication::objectManager(). The most important feature is the global object pool in which objects can be registered either by the main application, or by plugins. The global object pool is especially useful in cases where plugins need to make objects available to other plugins or the main application. The object manager allows inspection of registered objects by providing a query function which returns all objects which implements a specific interface. For more information about the object manager see the the \ref page_object_management article.

\subsection the_basics_context_manager The Context Manager

The context manager allows management of contexts in an application. It can be accessed through the CONTEXT_MANAGER macro which is basically a shortcut to QtilitiesCoreApplication::contextManager(). A context can be anything that can be presented by a string. For example, if you assign two different contexts to two widgets and you show each widget, the active context will be determined by the active widget. This exact approach is used for action management which is described in more detail in the next section. For more information about the context manager see the \ref context_manager section of the \ref page_action_management article.

\subsection the_basics_action_manager The Action Manager

The action manager allows management of actions, shortcuts and menu related items in an application. It can be accessed through the ACTION_MANAGER macro which is basically a shortcut to QtilitiesApplication::actionManager(). For more information about the action manager see the \ref action_manager section of the \ref page_action_management article.

\subsection the_basics_clipboard_manager The Clipboard Manager

The clipboard manager simplifies the use of the Qt Clipboard. It can be accessed through the CLIPBOARD_MANAGER macro which is basically a shortcut to QtilitiesApplication::clipboardManager(). For more information about the clipboard manager see the \ref clipboard_manager section of the \ref page_action_management article.

Now that the managers have been discussed, lets look at the rest of the example in detail.

\code
QtilitiesApplication a(argc, argv);
QtilitiesApplication::setOrganizationName("Jaco Naude");
QtilitiesApplication::setOrganizationDomain("Qtilities");
QtilitiesApplication::setApplicationName("Simple Example");
QtilitiesApplication::setApplicationVersion("0.1");

// Create a main window for our application
QMainWindow* mainWindow = new QMainWindow();
QtilitiesApplication::setMainWindow(mainWindow);
\endcode

As mentioned already, the Qtilities::CoreGui::QtilitiesApplication provides an extension of QApplication. We set up the normal parameters in QApplication in the first few lines. %Qtilities uses QSettings in multiple places and therefore it is needed to provide these details to QApplication in the beginning of your main function. Next we create a main window and set it as our application's main window using the QtilitiesApplication::setMainWindow() function. This is an important line since the action manager needs a main window to add front-end actions of Qtilities::CoreGui::MultiContextAction objects. If you don't provide a main window reference the multi context actions will not work as intended and shortcuts won't trigger them. The action manager will notify you about this through a message box when the application starts. 
It is not necessary to use the QtilitiesApplication object as shown in this example. For more information see the Qtilities::CoreGui::QtilitiesApplication::initialize().

\code
// Create an object and register it in the global object pool
QObject obj;
OBJECT_MANAGER->registerObject(&obj);
\endcode

In the next part of our example we register a QObject reference in the global object pool. The object will now be visible throughout the application even though we don't use it again in this example.

\code
// Create an example context and register it in the context manager
QString my_context = "My Context";
int my_context_id = CONTEXT_MANAGER->register(my_context);

// Create an action and register it in the action manager under our context
QAction* my_action = new QAction(QIcon(),"My Action");
my_action->setShortcut(QKeySequence(QKeySequence::HelpContents));
my_action->setEnabled(false);
ACTION_MANAGER->registerAction("Actions.myAction",my_action,my_context_id);  

// Now lets set our context active. This will enable my_action
CONTEXT_MANAGER->setNewContext(my_context);
\endcode

In the last section of the example we create a simple context and add register it in the context manager. Next we create an action and register it in the action manager with our context. The last thing we do is to set our context as active. The \p setNewContext() function will broadcast the state of the context manager and our action will become the active back-end action for the \p Actions.myAction action in the action manager. Pressing \p F1 will trigger our action when the back-end action is active.

This example introduced some of the core concepts in %Qtilities and most of the other features uses these concepts in one way or another. For example some widgets automatically add their actions to the action manager and registers corresponding contexts in the context manager. Therefore it is important to understand the concepts presented here while exploring the rest of the features found in %Qtilities. 

Now that the basics are covered check out the \ref page_examples_and_plugins and take a look at some of the articles which provides in depth overviews of feature areas found in %Qtilities at the <a href="#top" title="Back to top">top</a> of this page.
