\section widget_set_overview Overview%Qtilities provides a number of easy to use and useful widgets to use in Qt applications. This page provides an overview of those widgets.Table of contents:- \ref search_box_widget- \ref property_editor_interface- \ref qtilities_main_window- \ref logging_widgets- \ref logging_widgets- \ref configuration_widget- \ref about_window- \ref icons\section search_box_widget Search Box WidgetThe Qtilities::Widgets::SearchBoxWidget class provides a ready to use, customizable search box widget. The search box is used internally in %Qtilities in classes such as Qtilities::CoreGui::ObserverWidget and Qtilities::CoreGui::WidgetLoggerEngineFrontend. See the class documentation for more details.Below is a screenshot of the search box widget in search and replace mode with all buttons enabled:\image html search_box_widget.jpg "Search Box Widget"\image latex search_box_widget.eps "Search Box Widget" width=\textwidth\section property_editor_interface Property Editor InterfaceThe Qtilities::CoreGui::ObjectPropertyBrowser class provides an easy to use interface to the <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products/appdev/add-on-products/catalog/4/Widgets/qtpropertybrowser/">Qt Property Browser Framework</a>. Through the interface you can view the Q_PROPERTY properties of any object and it is possible to filter which subclasses of the object can be set. See the class documentation for more information.Below is a screenshot of the property editor widget in the tree browser mode. For a list of the available modes, see the Qtilities::CoreGui::ObjectPropertyBrowser::BrowserType enumeration.\image html property_editor_tree_browser.jpg "Property Browser (Tree Browser Mode)"\image latex property_editor_tree_browser.eps "Property Browser (Tree Browser Mode)" width=3in \section qtilities_main_window Qtilities Main Window Architecture%Qtilities provides a main window architecture which allows you to create complex main windows easily. The Qtilities::CoreGui::QtilitiesMainWindow class is the main class. It supports modes that can be added to it, where modes are classes implementing the Qtilities::CoreGui::Interfaces::IMode interface. Each mode provide a widget which and an icon identifying the mode. Modes are listed in in a top to bottom list view on the left hand of the main window and when a mode is clicked, its widget is set as the active widget in the main window. The Qtilities::CoreGui::DynamicSideWidgetViewer class is able to display widgets implementing the Qtilities::CoreGui::Interfaces::ISideViewerWidget interface. Each side viewer is wrapped using the Qtilities::CoreGui::DynamicSideWidgetWrapper class which provides actions to remove the side viewer or to duplicate the side viewer. The side viewer wrapper also allows side viewer widgets to add custom actions to the wrapper widget.Below is an example of the main window architecture in action. This screenshot was taken form the MainWindowExample in the QtilitiesExamples project:\image html main_window_architecture.jpg "Example Of Main Window Architecture"\image latex main_window_architecture.eps "Example Of Main Window Architecture" width=\textwidth\section logging_widgets Logging WidgetsWhen using the %Qtilities logger you can use the Qtilities::CoreGui::LoggerGui class to obtain logging widgets as well as a configuration widget for the logger. See the class documentation for more information.Below is an example dock log widget. Note the ready to use search box widget at the bottom of the log window.\image html log_dock_widget.jpg "Log Dock Widget"\image latex log_dock_widget.eps "Log Dock Widget" width=\textwidth\section configuration_widget Configuration Widget (Application Settings)The Qtilities::CoreGui::ConfigurationWidget class provides a ready to use application settings widget. See the class documentation for more information.Below is an example configuartion widget taken from the Object Management Example in the QtilitiesExamples project:\image html project_configuration_widget.jpg "Project Configuration Widget"\image latex project_configuration_widget.eps "Project Configuration Widget" width=\textwidth\section about_window About WindowThe Qtilities::CoreGui::AboutWindow provides a simple and easy to use about window for your applications. Below is an example of the about window displayed when calling the Qtilities::CoreGui::QtilitiesGuiCore::aboutQtilities() slot.\image html about_window.jpg "About Window"\image latex about_window.eps "About Window" width=5in\section icons Ready to use icons%Qtilities provides a range of ready to use icons which are part of the Qtilities::CoreGui module which is also internally used by many classes. A list of available icons can be found under the Qtilities::CoreGui::Icons namespace.*/
