{"name":"Qtilities","tagline":"Building blocks for Qt applications","body":"Introduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nQtilities is a set of Qt C++ libraries which provides building blocks for Qt applications, allowing rapid application development. The project consists of different modules which provide features which are common to a wide range of Qt applications, with the main goal of making common things easier to do.\r\n\r\nBuilding & Getting Started\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nThe following files in the repository's root folder will guide you through the process of building Qtilities:\r\n\r\n* On Windows see \"Building on Windows.txt\"\r\n* On Linux see \"Building on Linux.txt\"\r\n\r\nAlternatively see http://www.qtilities.org/docs/master/page_getting_started.html. The documentation can be compiled by providing Doxygen with the /doc/doxyfile_website input file. On Windows you can run the /doc/win32_website.bat file directly if doxygen is in your path. Note that Doxygen versions prior to v1.7.4 generates garbage in some parts of the documentation.\r\n\r\nMore Information\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe best place to get updates and general information about the project is to follow Qtilities on twitter: http://twitter.com/#!/qtilities\r\n\r\nFor any questions or comments, please use any of the resources below:\r\n\r\n* Email: support@qtilities.org\r\n* Website: http://www.qtilities.org\r\n* Source Repo & Bug Tracker: http://github.com/JPNaude/Qtilities\r\n* Blog: http://qtilities.blogspot.com\r\n* Discussions & Mailing List: http://groups.google.com/group/qtilities?hl=en?hl=en\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n---------\r\nSee http://www.qtilities.org/licensing.html for licensing details.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2009-2013, Floware Computing (Pty) Ltd\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-17785825-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
