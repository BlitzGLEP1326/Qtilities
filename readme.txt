Qtilities Source Archive Readme:

The source archive consists of the following folders

/doc         - Documentation

For information on how to get started with Qtilities, please see http://www.qtilities.org/docs/page_getting_started.html. Alternatively you can also compile the documentation from the sources by providing Doxygen with the /doc/doxyfile_website input file. On Windows you can run the /doc/win32_website.bat file directly if doxygen is in your path.
